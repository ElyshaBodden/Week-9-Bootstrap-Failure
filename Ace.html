<h1>Meet Ace of Spades a.k.a Ace</h1>
<p class="headerimg"><img src="Ace 2.jpg" alt="Pic of Ace. Brown Dog holding a weight."></p>


<p>Ace is 11 years old and weighs about 24 lbs.</p>
<p>He is an April baby. </p>
<p>Though he is an older dog, he still behaves and plays like he is a puppy.</p>

<ul class="otherpg">
    <li>Obsessed with balls and playing catch</li> 
    <li>Can and will play for hours with a ball</li> 
    <li>Will fiercly protect anyone from loud, scary noises</li>
    <li>Loves food and will eat almost everything you give him (except vegetables because ew)</li> 
</ul>

<p>Ace was our family's third dog and he has grown with me over the years.</p>
<p> I am not only grateful to have him in my life but grateful to be able to grow beside him.</p>
